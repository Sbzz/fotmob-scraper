- Files generated by the script may not persist after the run unless uploaded to external storage (e.g., S3, Google Drive).

---

## Troubleshooting

- If you see `Found 0 'Player of the Match' awards`, FotMob might have changed their website structure.  
  Update the selectors in `fotmob_advanced_enzo_scraper.py` or consider using FotMob's unofficial API if available.
- For dynamic content (loaded via JavaScript), the script may need to be adapted to use Selenium or similar tools, or switch to the API.

---

## Requirements

- Python 3.8 or newer
- See `requirements.txt` for dependencies
